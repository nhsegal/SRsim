The inspiration for this sim comes from David Mermin's book *It's About Time.* I have used this sim to illustrate points during lecture and to make figures for worksheets. It depicts the worldlines of two clocks - one colored black, one colored red. The user can adjust the velocity of each clock and see how time dilates accordingly. The user can also chose to display lines marking simultaneous events for the black clock and/or the red clock. I recently rewrote the sim using Desmos. The desmos version is [here](https://nhsegal.github.io/timedilation/).
