      <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
      This is a spacetime diagram. It's like a position-time graph with the axes
      inverted; time is the vertical axis and position is the horizontal axis. A
      vertical line represents something at rest (i.e. maintaining the same
      location as time progresses). The diagram shows how time differs for
      observers in relative motion. There is a black frame of reference and a
      red frame of reference. Each frame has a clock, which is at rest at the
      origin within its respective reference frame.

      <h2>What are the circles?</h2>
      These represent clocks. There is a single black clock and a single red
      clock shown at successive moments in time. The numbers inside represents
      the clocks' time readings.
      <h2>What are the diagonal green dashed lines?</h2>
      These represent light signals. Since nothing can move faster than speed of
      light, each clock's worldline cannot tilt from the vertical more than the
      dashed lines.

      <h2>What are "lines of simultaneity?"</h2>
      Everything on the same black dashed line happens at the same time for
      someone at rest in the black frame - those things all happen at the
      instant that the black clock on the line has its given value. If red is in
      motion relation to black, its notion of simultaneity differs, and the red
      dashed line do not coincide with the black ones.

      <h2>How does this diagram show time dilation?</h2>
      We can see that the greater the speed of a clock, the more vertical
      spacing between circle, which means more time elaspes between ticks.
      <h2>
        How does this show the equivalence of different inertial frames?
      </h2>
      When the lines of simultaneity are displayed, you can see the symmetry in
      time dilation. If black and red are in relative motion, each judges the
      other's clock to be running more slowly.

      <h2>How does this diagram show the Doppler effect?</h2>
      If you display the light signals send from one clock to the other, you can
      see frequency at which they are received is lower than the frequency they
      are emitted. Note that this effect is symmetric between the two frames and that
      the factor by with the frequency is reduced is different than the factor
      by which each clock judges the other to be slowed.
